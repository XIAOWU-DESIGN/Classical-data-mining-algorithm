# Machine-learning-in-action
This is one of my study notes. It contains some machine learning algorithms as well as other classic algorithms. C4.5, k-Means, SVM, Apriori, AdaBoost, kNN, Naive Bayes, CART, LDA, Regression model, etc.
The source code comes from the book "Machine Learning in Action".
In order to run under python3.6, the code has been modified appropriately.
In order to promote beginners' understanding of the code, comments are added after important code sentences.
